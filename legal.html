Going forward, notices of claimed infringement shall not contain: (a) an offer to settle the claimed infringement; (b) a request or demand, made in relation to the claimed infringement, for payment or for personal information; or (c) a reference, including by way of hyperlink, to such an offer, request or demand. A non-compliant notice does not trigger the obligation of the internet service provider or host to pass the notice on to the alleged infringer and to otherwise preserve that person's identity for subsequent enforcement proceedings.</blockquote><hr/></div><hr><footer><p class="unimportant" style="margin-top:20px;text-align:center;">- Tinyboard + <a href="https://engine.vichan.net/">vichan</a>&nbsp5.1.4 + <a href="https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan">NPFchan</a> + <a href="https://github.com/ECHibiki/ViQa-Kissu/">Kissu</a>&nbsp6.1.3 - <br>Tinyboard Copyright &copy; 2010-2014 Tinyboard Development Group<br><a href="https://engine.vichan.net/">vichan</a> Copyright &copy; 2012-2018 vichan-devel<br><a href="https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan">NPFchan</a> Copyright &copy; 2017-2018 NPFchan<br><a href="https://github.com/ECHibiki/ViQa-Kissu/">Kissu</a>  2018-2020<br/> <a href="/legal.html">Legal</a>&emsp;<a href="/rules.html">Rules</a></p><p class="unimportant" style="text-align:center;">All trademarks, copyrights, comments, and images on this page are owned by and are the responsibility of their respective parties.</p><p class="unimportant" style="text-align:center;">Concerns to the gmail of ECVerniy</p><a style="opacity:0;position:absolute;top: -100em;" href="https://info.flagcounter.com/CexS"><img src="https://s11.flagcounter.com/count2/CexS/bg_FFFFFF/txt_000000/border_CCCCCC/columns_2/maxflags_10/viewers_0/labels_0/pageviews_0/flags_0/percent_0/" alt="Flag Counter" border="0"></a></footer></body></html>
